This course will build the skills and knowledge needed to interpret, critique, and communicate outputs from data-analytic workflows and processes. Key issues discussed will include data visualization, model parameterization, sensitivity analysis, and summarizing results for a variety of audiences.

This project was in consultation with an environmental agriculture association aiming to understand barriers to the adoption of specific farming practices, specifically the use of cover crops. Figure 2.1: Red Clover cover crops on farm field. Image credit: https://www.country-guide.ca/ The survey asked farmers about their use of cover crops and any barriers they experienced in applying this practice to their farms. We will walk-through a detailed analysis of this farmer survey data, which is primarily tabular data with some spatial and temporal components. First, let’s look at the raw data. Figure 2.2: Snapshot of farmer survey data Some things you need to check when inspecting a new dataset, include at least the following: are the column names well-formed what columns have NULL values, will this cause an issue ** how are NULL values coded, is it consistent? do any columns have a mix of data types? (e.g., see column AH) is there data that should anonymized? are there gaps above or below the data, or ad hoc summaries that need to be removed? are there any obviously erroneous values (i.e., not valid outliers but errors, such as a value of 491 in the age column) that need to be removed As well as some deeper questions: do you understand what each column and value means, what each row represents? If there are some you do not understand consider whether the columns you do understand are sufficient to answer the key questions you’re exploring with this dataset are the data stored in the correct data type (especially important if viewing data in Microsoft Excel) are the data complete? (i.e., are all the expected rows there, does the rowcount = the sample size) Secondly, let’s examine the end product we created to explore this data. The graphs here were used in a report summarizign key trends. Figure 2.3: Screenshot of farmer survey report.

["assignments.html", "Chapter 3 Assignments 3.1 Assignment 1 - Exploratory Visulization in ggplot 3.2 Assignment 2 - Spatial and temporal visualization of urban data", " Chapter 3 Assignments 3.1 Assignment 1 - Exploratory Visulization in ggplot Your objective in this assignment is to select a datset and do some exploratory analysis and visualization. You should select a dataset that interests you from this online repository of datasets from various R packages. The dataset you select should be different from other members of the class. Questions 1-4 should be completed with on selected dataset, and question 5 should be completed with another dataset. You have to structure your assignment as a r mardown file. Watch this video (~45 mins) to learn how to start and navigate markdown files in R-Studio. Disclaimer: I am not endorsing buying these courses - this is just a straightforward introduction to get up to up and running with R-markdown. You can use the following as a template [download to your working directory, and open in R-studio to edit/knit] to get you started for your assignment. Your assignment should answer the following questions and be totally reproducible.This means that you must read data in from a URL so that I can replicate your work, do not include any external data files in your submission, only submit one .Rmd file. 3.1.1 Questions Explain in a couple of sentences why you selected this dataset. [2 marks] Create a bar plot using ggplot2 graphing. Write a sentence interpreting what is happening in the graph. Make sure you read up on the documentation of the data to understand what is represented and how it was measured. [5 marks] Create a line or point plot using ggplot2 graphing. Write a sentence interpreting what is happening in the graph. Make sure you read up on the documentation of the data to understand what is represented and how it was measured. [5 marks] Create any other plot of your choosing using ggplot2 graphing. Write a sentence interpreting what is happening in the graphy. Make sure you read up on the documentation of the data to understand what is represented and how it was measured. [5 marks] Select another dataset and tell a story with the data. Think about who a potential audience is for your story. Using the structure outlined in lecture slides, write a sentence or two for each phase of the data story: Opening, Challenge, Action, and Resolution. For each, include a visualization to illustrate (which may or may not be a graph of the data- external sources can be used here as well). In order to understand the context of the data, you will have to do some background research into the dataset this is generally available in the documentation. The story should include at least three graphs you create from the data(which must be labelled correctly and not be duplicates of graphs for questions 2-4). [15 marks] What might or could you have done differently in question 5 if you were preparing the analysis for another audience/user community? [5 marks] 3.1.2 Submission Submit via email to Colin at the start of class on January 25 3.2 Assignment 2 - Spatial and temporal visualization of urban data Your objective in this assignment is to perform a real-world analysis of geospatial data from an urban centre. In this assignment you are taking on the role of an geospatial consultant tasked with analyzing aspects of the transportation system in a Canadian city that will be assigned to you. The specific explored is up to you and to some extent will be a function of the available data, but feel free to do some background research. Jean-Pierre - Montreal Nahal - Vancouver Sheyda - Toronto Anju - Calgary Transportation issues are always top of mind in Canadian cities and you can choose to focus on aspects of the street network, availability of transit relative to population, actual commuting data, etc. It is up to you to define a reasonable question to explore and to source appropriate data for this assignment. Every city has an open data portal with some data that will likely be of help, however you can also seek data from other sources. I will be happy to help you with accessing datasets. The outcome of this project is an r-markdown report report detailing the issues explored (approximately 5 written pages double-spaced), the datasets, and the analysis performed. Visualizaiton outputs should be presented in an appendix and an accompying 10 minute presentation to be done in class on March 1st (remote attendance is OK as well). The assignment will be graded on the following criteria: depth of analysis (25%) visual aesthetics (25%) reproducability (10%) analysis interpretation and accuracy (20%) presentation (20%) Recall some of the ideas about story-telling with data as you think through and put together your analysis and report. 3.2.1 Submission Submit the markdown report via email to Colin at the start of class on March 1, presentations will take place that day as well.
