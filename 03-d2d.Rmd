<!-- # Data to Decisions -->

<!-- Geospatial imagery is an increasingly important type of information source for EDA applications. We consider any image data where earth/environment is captured on pixel arrays and used to better understand environmental phenomena. Such a broad approach to geospatial imagery captures tradtional sources such as earth-observation satellite-based sensors as well as non-traditional platforms such as smartphone cameras, RPS-based image sources, and handheld imaging platforms. Depending on how geospatial information is integrated into image data, there are different considerations for how you might integrated them within a project. We will review some common issues and techniques for handling a variety of image data sources in this chapter. -->
